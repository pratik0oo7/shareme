Sharik is an open-source, cross-platform solution for sharing files via Wi-Fi or Mobile Hotspot.


This app allows you to easily send photos, apps, files, text, literally anything, to any kind of device connected to the same network. It's convenient and blazing fast.


After selecting a language and going through the intro, you can see the sharing buttons and the history of files you shared on the main screen. You can share images, files, installed apps, or simply text. After selecting the file, you will be shown the Sharing screen. Here you can see your connectivity status (Wi-Fi/Mobile Hotspot) and the URL you need to open on the other device. After typing this URL in the browser and hitting Enter on the other machine, the file will start downloading. Please make sure that both devices are connected to the same network.


If you have Sharik installed on both devices, you can simply click the button "Receive" on the bottom panel of the app. After clicking, the Receiver screen will be shown. If Sharik detects another device sharing a file in your local network, it will be displayed. If you click on it, the browser will appear, and the download will start.


Sharik is entirely free to use, and it contains no ads. Moreover, its source code is published on GitHub so that everyone can contribute to the development process. So, if you like it, please leave a star on our GitHub repository, and consider contributing: add a new language or help us with code.


Sharik was built using Flutter. It is published under an open license (MIT).
